# Spread Optimiser
## A Pokemon EV Spread Optimiser
### Created by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington))

## Introduction
This tool is an EV Spread Optimiser for competitive Pokemon, where constraints can be applied
in an attempt to generate an ev spread which invests in relevant stats which provide the most
benefit overall. This is done by investing more in lower base-stats, and higher base stats are
generally boosted by nature and / or can be set to use a 'jump stat' (where 4/8 evs provide 2 
stat points instead of 1). Speed can be constrained to a relevant benchmark (outspeeding jolly
252 base 100s, etc.) or can be customised to fit your own benchmarks. For more information on
how this tool should be used, please see [usage.md](./usage.md)
