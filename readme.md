# Spread Optimiser
## A Pokemon EV Spread Optimiser
### Created by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington))

## Introduction
The Spread Optimiser is a html/css/js application which given a Pokemon, Nature, IVs and the
minimum and maximum EV constraints calculates the base stat total of every possible EV spread
combination with the given constraints and provides them to a user in a table. The table is
able to be sorted by each stat, including overall base stat total. This was developed to allow
competitive Pokemon players to develop better optimised EV spreads, and is intended to
compliment spread development.
